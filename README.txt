Audiofilters, Fourier Synthesis and Analysis
(c) 2015, Andreas Umbach <andreas@umbach.ch>

I wrote this project for a course I teach, so students can play a
little with Fourier-Synthesis.  It's incomplete, and there are
probably a few bugs, but you might find it useful nonetheless. If so,
drop me a line!
